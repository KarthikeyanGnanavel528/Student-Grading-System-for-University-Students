**🎓 Student Grading System for University Students**

This project is a simple and user-friendly web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, specially designed for university students to store their academic grades, calculate GPA (Grade Point Average) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average), and manage their performance across semesters.

**🚀 Features**

*🔢 GPA & CGPA Calculator*

Students can input their subject marks, and the system will automatically calculate their semester GPA and overall CGPA based on university rules and can download them in pdf format.

*📥 Student Data Storage*

Each student can enter and store their academic details, like name, register number, semester marks, and subject credits. The data is saved using a backend database with PHP + MySQL.

*🖥️ Frontend + Backend Integration*

The project shows how the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) interacts smoothly with the backend (PHP + MySQL) to handle data validation, storage, and retrieval.

*🧮 Real-time Calculations*

As soon as students enter their marks, GPA and CGPA are calculated instantly using JavaScript.

*✅ Simple UI for Easy Access*

The interface is designed to be clean, simple, and mobile-friendly so that any student can use it easily without any confusion.
